# Code-Institute_5-Step-Coding-Challenge

## Acknowledgement

I have found this challenge very enjoyable.  It has taught me the basics and concepts of html, css and javascript, 
as well as importing from 3rd parties (such as font awesome) and responsive web development.
The folders DAY-1 to DAY-5 have been kept, to show the gradual changes and concepts introduced, with comments where
relevant.  The final .html with associated .css and .js files can be found in the FINAL folder.

I would like to mention that although I have baked this recipe a couple of times, it is not mine. (The image is mine, though!)

I have used it purely as an example within this coding challenge.
The recipe can be found [here](https://www.janespatisserie.com/book/), in the first fabulous book by the amazing Jane Dunn.
